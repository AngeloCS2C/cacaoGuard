          'CPB attacks both young and mature cocoa pods. A common symptom of infested pods is unevenness and premature ripening. Infestation of young pods results in heavy losses because the quantity and quality of the bean becomes seriously affected. A CPB moth is 7mm long and brown in colour with a white strip on the forewings. The female lives for about 5-7 days and lays 100-200 eggs on the surface of the cocoa pod. The larval period is about 14-18 days, then 5-8 days before hatching as a moth. source link: https://apps.lucidcentral.org/pppw_v10/text/web_full/entities/cocoa_pod_borer_175.htmc',
